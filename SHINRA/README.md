## 💡 Project Overview

**SHINRA** is a custom-designed AI assistant system integrating voice control, facial recognition, hardware interaction, and real-time alerting — all tailored for high-frequency trading (HFT) environments and real-world automation tasks.

This is not just a voice assistant. It is a scalable, modular system designed to learn, respond, and integrate into both personal and professional ecosystems.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ Offline voice command system with natural language processing
- 🧠 Memory recall and assistant behavior customization
- 👁️ Facial recognition using OpenCV
- 📈 Real-time alert system for financial data streams
- ⚙️ Integration with Raspberry Pi and Arduino for physical interface (e.g. helmet)
- 🖥️ Dark-themed control dashboard (React or Electron for future build)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – core logic, AI flow, OpenCV
- **LangChain / GPT APIs** – future support for language-based task execution
- **Speech Recognition (Coqui, pyttsx3)** – STT and TTS
- **MongoDB / Local DB** – lightweight memory structure
- **Arduino, Raspberry Pi** – hardware sensors and controller
- **MQTT / Socket** – communication protocols
