🚀 Project Vision

SHINRA is a self-designed, intelligent AI assistant system inspired by futuristic human-AI interaction concepts. It aims to serve as a personalized digital companion capable of voice commands, automation, smart device integration, and potential financial decision support in high-frequency trading (HFT) environments.

This is a student-led innovation project representing a blend of creativity, technology, and ambition to build a Jarvis-like assistant.
