# SHINRA – Personal AI Assistant + Financial Alert System

> **By Dev Tennyson – 12th Grade Visionary | AI + HFT + Automation**

---

## 🧠 About the Project

**SHINRA** is my personal futuristic project—a voice-enabled, modular AI assistant with real-world applications, especially in **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**. Inspired by systems like JARVIS (but built from scratch, my way), it merges AI + Hardware + Financial Logic into one smart system.

This is more than code—it's a personal mission I’m evolving semester by semester.
